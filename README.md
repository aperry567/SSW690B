# Overview of the Doctors On Demand App developed by Ayana, Jinal, John and Tony

DoD was developed to allow patients to talk to a Doctor whenever, regardless of whether you have medical insurance coverage or not.  
Medical Care 24/7 is the future for treating patients.  The Doctors on Demand App has been developed by a team who wanted to make an impact on the medical industry as we know it. The DoD App goal is to reach anyone who does not want to wait days to visit a doctor or must book an in-person appointment just to speak with their primary care physician. The focus for now is on the national level with the intent to expand internationally in the future. So, come and sign up and enjoy a new fresh idea to modern medicine as we know it.
